		<p>Hello there! I'm Orvus and this is my website! I know, I know... it sucks. That's because I'm learing how to make a website through coding.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Why? Because vibe coding leaves security risks, and well I want to know what it is I'm puttting in my site. Kind of like how you don't put what you don't know into your body.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Well, that's all for now. Thanks for visiting my site!</p>

		<p>    - Your technological overlord, Orvus</p>
